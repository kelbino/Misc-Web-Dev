  <h1>ABT RS3</h1>
  <h3><a href="another_page" title="This Leads you to another page">More Info</a></h3>

  <p>Just pretty and white? The demonstration model for the RS 3 tuning program
     has more to offer, like the ABT SPORT GR alloy wheels in 8.5x20 inch.
     The design features ten spokes which bisect towards the rim flange, the
     recessed hub area and the strongly concave rim base. While the fully
     diamond-polished surface of the matte black version creates a high level
     of plasticity and elegance, the glossy black finish with diamond polishing
     only on the flange appears more aggressive. After all, this is a vehicle
     with lots of temperament!</p>

  <p>With 500 HP (368 kW) and 570 Nm, the ABT Power R power boost ensures that
    the fast compact car does not take root. The company prises the enormous
    power from the 400 HP (294 kW) strong production engine with the ABT Engine
    Control (AEC) unit. An ABT intercooler and a special ABT exhaust system
    were also fitted. With this power, the compact car can reach up to 186 mph
    and rockets from 0 to 62 mph in 3.7 seconds. But even without the additional
    hardware, the five-cylinder engine in the RS 3 already has significant
    potential: The ABT Power boost relies exclusively on the AEC and employs
    460 HP (338 kW). Unlike the Edelweiss, the ABT RS3 Sportback is not a
    protected species, but risk prevention is still a priority. Careful
    engineering, effective engine protection measures and test runs on the
    chassis dynamometer and on public roads are cultivating driving pleasure
    without remorse.</p>
